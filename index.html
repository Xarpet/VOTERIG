      Throughout your experience as a VOTERIGging county commissioner, you used smart placement of polling locations to guarantee your party a victory in the local election. While the game is a simplification, and the purple, green, and orange parties have nothing but a coincidental resemblance to real-life political parties, tactics like the ones you made use of are used time and time again by actual politicians to impact election results through manipulating voter turnout. While not as sensationalized as national elections, the results of local elections have huge impacts on your daily life--from how much public schools are funded, to the maintenance of local roads and infrastructure, and the quality of emergency medical services. As you grow and take part in the historic "great experiment" that is American democracy, keep in mind all the subtle ways in which the powers that be make it hard for us to exercise our most important civic duty. And if you get the chance, become part of the solution!

          Hello, VOTERIGger! You are the county commissioner of a town of 2000 people, where half the population votes Purple and the other half votes Green. While you would think election results in this town are 50/50, studies show that the likelihood of a voter showing up to the ballot box decreases as the distance they have to travel to vote increases. As a loyal member of the <span style="color: #b4a7d6">Purple</span> party, it is your job to VOTERIG and pick polling locations (hint: they can overlap, and this is actually a common practice called polling place consolidation) that maximize the turnout of Purple voters. Carefully drag and drop locations for polling booths so that the Purple party wins the election!

          Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing the boundaries of electoral districts in a way that gives one political party an unfair advantage over its rivals (political or partisan gerrymandering) or that dilutes the voting power of members of ethnic or linguistic minority groups (racial gerrymandering).
